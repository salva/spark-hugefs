## spark-hugefs

Spark is commonly used with remote file systems that are relatively
slow, specially for operations related to walking the file structure.

This package provides methods that allow one to retrieve the file
structure fast and efficiently, taking advantage of Spark
parallelization infrastructure.

## Example

```scala
import com.github.salva.spark.hugefs.Walker

val w = Walker(spark.sparkContext)
val df = w.walk("/dbfs/mnt/fs1", Good.isFile.glob("**/images/*.jpg"))
println("%s JPEG images found in directory", df.count)
```

## Documentation

This is yet a work in progress. Documentation is comming!
